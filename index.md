I am a researcher working at the [Department of Chemistry](http://www.helsinki.fi/kemia/english/) of the [University of Helsinki](http://www.helsinki.fi/en). My research focuses on electronic structure theories, that is, mathematical models for the behavior of molecules and molecular clusters, and the computer implementations thereof. See my list of publications [here](publications).

I finished my PhD studies at the [Department of Physics of the University of Helsinki](http://www.physics.helsinki.fi/english) in 2013, followed by a postdoctorate stint 2013-2014 at the [Department of Applied Physics](http://physics.aalto.fi) at [Aalto University](http://www.aalto.fi/en/). Then, I was at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](http://lbl.gov/) for three years 2014-2017, working in the [Martin Head-Gordon group](https://mhggroupberkeley.com/) at [University of California, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu). Since fall 2017, I have been working at the University of Helsinki, thanks to a three-year, independent [Academy of Finland](http://www.aka.fi/en/) postdoctoral fellowship.

As a theoretical physicist by training, I got interested in fundamental quantum chemistry during my graduate studies. I also don't mind getting my hands dirty with writing (or debugging) code. One of my main works has been [ERKALE](http://github.com/susilehtola/erkale/), which is a Hartree-Fock / density-functional theory self-consistent field program I wrote during my PhD, which focuses on the modeling of x-ray properties. I'd be happy to hear if you have found the program useful. I'm also one of the authors of [the Libxc library](http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/wiki/index.php/Libxc) of exchange-correlation functionals for density functional theory. In addition, I have made contributions to [Q-Chem](http://www.q-chem.com), [Psi4](http://github.com/psi4/psi4), and [PySCF](http://github.com/sunqm/pyscf). My most recent work has been focusing on finite element approaches to electronic structure theory, which has resulted in [the HelFEM program](http://github.com/susilehtola/HelFEM/) for accurate calculations on atoms and diatomic molecules at the Hartree-Fock / density-functional level of theory.

Partly in relation to my scientific interests, I am also involved as a package maintainer in the [Fedora project](http://www.fedoraproject.org), as it makes installing necessary software on computing clusters very easy. For more information on that, see my [Fedora homepage](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Jussilehtola).
