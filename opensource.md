I have been an advocate for free and open source software (FOSS) since
high school. I've been a Linux user since the late 1990s, and switched
to Linux on my desktop in the early 2000s.

I am a firm believer of the importance of FOSS in science; see [our
recent review on FOSS for computational chemistry
education](https://doi.org/10.1002/wcms.1610) for in-depth reasoning.
Most of my software contributions are available as FOSS. I am the lead
author of a number of free and open source software projects

+ [HelFEM](https://github.com/susilehtola/HelFEM)
+ [ERKALE](https://github.com/susilehtola/ERKALE)
+ [Libxc](https://gitlab.com/libxc/libxc)

and am a contributor to a number of other FOSS projects including

+ [Psi4](https://github.com/psi4/psi4)
+ [PySCF](https://github.com/pyscf/pyscf)
+ [Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/)
